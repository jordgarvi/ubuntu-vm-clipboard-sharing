## Environment

- **Host OS**: Windows 11 (24H2)  
- **Guest OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS  
- **Virtualization Platform**: VirtualBox 7.1+

---

## Objective

Enable **bidirectional clipboard sharing**, so you can:

- âœ… Copy text from Ubuntu â†’ paste into Windows  
- âœ… Copy text from Windows â†’ paste into Ubuntu

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Install Required Packages in Ubuntu

This installs kernel headers and tools needed to compile VirtualBox Guest Additions.

In the Ubuntu terminal, run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

### Step 2: Insert Guest Additions CD

In the **VirtualBox VM window**:

1. Click on `Devices â†’ Insert Guest Additions CD image...`  
2. Wait a few seconds for Ubuntu to detect and mount the disk  
3. If it doesnâ€™t auto-mount, mount it manually:

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/cdrom
sudo mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
```

### Step 3: Verify Guest Additions Is Active

I attempted to run the Guest Additions installer manually:

```bash
sudo /mnt/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
```

However, it returned the following error:

```bash
sudo: /mnt/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run: command not found
```

---

Instead, I verified the installation using:

```bash
lsmod | grep vbox
```

Output shows `vboxguest`, `vboxsf`, or `vboxvideo` modules are loaded, confirming Guest Additions is active.

### Step 4: Restart the VM (Optional)

To ensure all changes take effect, reboot your Ubuntu VM:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

---

### Step 5: Enable Bidirectional Clipboard in VirtualBox

After the reboot:

1. Go to the VM window â†’ `Devices â†’ Shared Clipboard â†’ Bidirectional`  
2. (Optional) Also enable `Drag and Drop â†’ Bidirectional`

## Verification Test

Try copying the following command from your host (Windows):

```bash
echo "Clipboard sharing works!"
```

Paste it into your Ubuntu VM terminal and run it. You should see:

## Summary

Getting bidirectional clipboard sharing working between an Ubuntu VM and a Windows host isnâ€™t always straightforward. Along the way, I faced some challenges, especially with running the Guest Additions installer manually, which didnâ€™t work as expected.  

However, after confirming the necessary kernel modules were loaded, the real breakthrough came when I enabled **Bidirectional Clipboard** (and optionally Drag and Drop) in the VirtualBox Devices menu (Step 5).  

This simple step finally unlocked seamless copy-paste functionality both ways, which has made working with the VM much smoother and more productive.  

If you run into issues, double check the Guest Additions installation and make sure those Devices menu options are enabled. Once everythingâ€™s set up, youâ€™ll be able to copy commands, text, and notes effortlessly between your host and VMâ€”saving you time and frustration.
